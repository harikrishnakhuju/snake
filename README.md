```bash
pip install pygame

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
python main.py
```

```


## Download & Run

You can download the pre-built executable (`main.exe`) from the [Releases](https://github.com/harikrishnakhuju/snake/blob/main/dists) section of this repository.

### Running the Game

1. Download the `main.exe` file to your local machine.
2. Double-click the `main.exe` file to launch the Snake game.
3. Make sure the `assets` folder is located in the same directory as the executable if you run the one-folder build.  
   *(For the one-file build, all assets are bundled inside the executable, so no extra files are needed.)*

### Troubleshooting

- If the game does not start, ensure that your system meets the requirements:
  - Windows 10 or later
  - No additional installation of Python or Pygame required
- If you see errors related to missing assets, try downloading the full repository or check that the assets folder is properly included.

If you want to build the executable yourself, follow the instructions in the **Build** section.
